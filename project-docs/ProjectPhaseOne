########## LIQUOR STORE PHASE 1 ##########

~~~~ Description ~~~~

Over the course of multiple phases, we will gradually build a program that simulates a Liquor Store.
In this first phase, we will define a basic product model and implement a simple inventory
management system. The first bit of code has been provided for you to get you started. Below are
the requirements for the program. This phase is complete when you have met all of the requirements.

~~~~ Requirements ~~~~

 - The program should define a what a product is.
 - The program should keep track of what products have been created and the quantities
     of each product in the inventory.
 - The program should display a list of commands and prompt the user for their command
     in a loop until the user exits the program.
 - If the user enters the "help" command...
        - the program should display the list of commands again.
 - If the user enters the "create" command...
        - the program should prompt the user for the data needed to create a new product.
 - If the use enters the "add" command...
        - the program should prompt the user for a product and a quantity to add to the inventory.
        - the program should notify the user if the product does not exist.
 - If the user enters the "remove" command...
        - the program should prompt the user for a product and a quantity to remove from the inventory.
        - the program should notify the user if the product does not exist or if there is not enough
            quantity in the inventory to perform the remove operation.
 - If the user enters the "get" command...
        - the program should prompt the user for a product and display the quantity of that product
            in the inventory.
 - If the user enters the "exit" command...
        - the program should end.
 - If the user enters anything else...
        - the program should notify the user the command is invalid.
 - After the program completes processing the user's command (except the "exit" command),
     it should ask the user for another command.
